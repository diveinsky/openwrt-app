## How to build

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/safedns/openwrt $HOME/openwrt
```

Clone LEDE source tree:

```
git clone https://github.com/lede-project/source $HOME/source
```

Now add path to the application source to feeds config:

```
cd $HOME/source
echo "src-link custom $HOME/openwrt/src/" >> feeds.conf.default
```

Run:

```
./scripts/feeds update -a; ./scripts/feeds install -a
```

Then set building options for your platform:

```
make menuconfig
```

You must choose right target architecture, turn on LuCI and SafeDNS-related
options as modules (`m`, not `y`). When you're done, run building:

```
make V=s
```

If your CPU has more than one core, you can run `make` with `-j$N`, where $N is
cores number plus one. `V=s` is for verbose output.

When building is complete you can find the packages at `bin/packages/$ARCH/custom`,
where $ARCH is your target architecture.
